# The Temerian Institute of Cartography
Welcome to the ICT ! Our Institute mission is to map every single place of the Witcher 3 maps. From White Orchard to Kaer Mohren, from Velen to Skellige, we'll do our best to make your life easier in these incredible places.

/!\ The Rasters files are missing for now (too heavy for github). They include all basemaps extracted from the RedKit (Foliage, Terrain, Normals, etc.)

# Join the project - mapper's side
You can join the team to help us creating the maps. You can DM me here on GitHub, on Reddit [u/iceSpurr ](https://www.reddit.com/user/iceSpurr/), or on Deviantart [iceSpurr](https://www.deviantart.com/icespurr).

Basically, anybody can join. Of course, if you know how to use QGIS, it's good. But if you don't, you could help us finding names for unnammed places, find hidden details in game, be a lore specialist, make the map renders, work on aesthetics... Everything is possible !

# How to download the data ?
Simply click on CODE (green button) -> download zip. You'll need QGIS to open most of the files, but you will also find :
- translation files, if you want to localise the map in your own language. Be warned : there are hundreds, if not thousands, of labels on the map to translate !
- in the RASTERS folder, you'll find data I've extracted from the RedKit. It includes the basic game map, elevation (that I found [here](https://github.com/Til-Weimann/witcher3-heightmaps)), Normals, Objects and Bridges, Foliage, Terrain, Roads, and Water. **Feel free to use it**, it could save you days of exporting these maps from the Redkit !
